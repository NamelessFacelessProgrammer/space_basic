space_basic.py

This code started as an exercise inspired by the discovery that
  zip(*tuple_of_numeric_tuples)
performs a matrix transposition, with the matrix represented as a tuple
of row tuples.  The challenge was to write a linear algebra package as
briefly as possible in pure python, and optimize the speed.

Excluding module test code, the result of the exercise is these 80
lines, only 40 of which are executable.

There will be no continuation of this development.  It is, rather, the
root of a sequence of forks that gradually add more function and improve
robustness and numeric speed, at the cost of increased complexity.

This code may be suitable for use in an embedded system where some
simple calculations need to be performed, but that can not justify the
overhead of a later fork or numpy.

The next level of complexity is expressed by space.py, directly forked
from this repository.

Since space_basic.py is exquisitely elementary, there is no license, and
is placed in the public domain by this repository.
